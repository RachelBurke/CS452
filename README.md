# CS452 - Parallel Algorithms - C++ with MPI
**Professor: Dr. Ankur Gupta** </br>
**Jan - May 2019**

This repository contains files from my CS452 course taken in the Spring of 2019 at Butler University. It contains course notes, and projects.

## Course Description
A study of theoretical and practical paradigms of parallel algorithm design. Topics include model costs, lower bounds, architecture and topology, data-parallelism, synchronization, transactional memory, message passing, and parallel design for sorting, graphs, string processing, and dynamic programming. Prerequisite: CS 351(U)(3)
